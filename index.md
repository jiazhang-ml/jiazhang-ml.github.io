#### Brief Biography

I am currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in the Artificial Intelligence Department of [Xiamen University (XMU)](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Shaozi Li](http://imt.xmu.edu.cn/szdw.html). During the period of doctoral study, I visited [Kay Chen Tan](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/kaytan.htm)'s group in the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) for three months. 

Research Interests: I am interested in *machine learning* and *data mining*. In particular, I am interested in classification (multi-label learning, weakly supervised learning, class-imbalance learning), feature selection and sparse learning, deep learning, data fusion, and recommendation systems. I am also interested in various data mining applications in medicine, such as TCM health management, drug discovery, hospital readmission, and autism spectrum disorder.
