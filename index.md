* #### What's Happening

    * June 2019, our paper on [Manifold Regularized Discriminative Feature Selection for Multi-label Learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320319302341) has been accepted to *Pattern Recognition*.

    * May 2019, I have moved to [CityU](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) for research study.

* #### Research Interests: Machine Learning, Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence
