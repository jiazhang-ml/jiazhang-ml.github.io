* #### What's Happening

    * June 2019, our paper on [Manifold Regularized Discriminative Feature Selection for Multi-label Learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320319302341) has been accepted to PR, and the code has been posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jiazhang-ml/MDFS).

    * May 2019, I have moved to [CityU](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) for research study.

* #### Research Interests

    * Multi-label learning: Label relationship exploitation and learning method, weakly supervised learning
 
    * Feature selection: Embedded method, mutual information-based method 

    * Deep learning: Multi-label classification, deep learning on graphs

    * Data fusion: Truth discovery, multi-view learning, transfer learning

    * Recommendation systems

    * Artificial intelligence in medicine: TCM health management, drug repositioning, hospital readmission, ASD prediction

* #### Publications: at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=yBaTk-gAAAAJ&hl=en) (2016 - date)

* #### Academic Talk and Discussion

    * Entropy-based collaborative filtering algorithm, Aug. 2015, The 15-th Chinese Conference on Machine Learning, Chengdu, P.R. China

* #### Professional Activities

    * Journal Reviewer: [*Pattern Recognition*](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/pattern-recognition/), [*IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems*](https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tnnls), [*Information Sciences*](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-sciences), [*Knowledge-Based Systems*](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/knowledge-based-systems)
