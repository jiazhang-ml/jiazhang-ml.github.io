**Short Biography:** I am now a lecturer at the [College of Information Science and Technology](http://xxxy2016.jnu.edu.cn/), [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn/). 

 I received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Informatics, Xiamen University in 2020, supervised by Prof. Shaozi Li. I was a visiting scholar at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by Kay Chen Tan.
