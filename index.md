#### Brief Biography

* I received the Ph.D. degree from the Artificial Intelligence Department, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 2020, under the supervision of Prof. [Shaozi Li](http://imt.xmu.edu.cn/szdw.html). In 2019, I visited [Kay Chen Tan](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/kaytan.htm)'s group in the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) for three months.

* I am broadly interested in machine learning, data mining, and artificial intelligence. Now I am working on weak label learning, data fusion, feature selection, knowledge graph, and some AI applications in medicine, such as TCM health management, drug discovery, hospital readmission, and autism spectrum disorder.

* I have published over 20 academic papers in some prestigious journals and conferences, such as Pattern Recognition, Knowledge-Based Systems, Information Sciences, Expert Systems with Applications, and IJCAI.
