**Short Biography:** I am currently a Lecturer in the [College of Information Science and Technology](https://xxxy.jnu.edu.cn/main.htm) of [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn/). I got my PhD from the [School of Informatics](https://informatics.xmu.edu.cn/), [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/), Xiamen, China, in 2020, supervised by [Prof. Shaozi Li](https://imt.xmu.edu.cn/info/1003/1182.htm). I was a visiting student at the City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Kay Chen Tan](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-tan-kay-chen/). 

**Research Interests:** My research interests include *machine learning* and *data mining*. In particular, I am interested in multi-label learning, weak label learning, feature selection, and information fusion. I am also interested in various machine learning applications in health care, bioinformatics, and human-computer interactions.
