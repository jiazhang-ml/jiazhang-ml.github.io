* #### What's Happening

    * June 2019, our paper on [Manifold Regularized Discriminative Feature Selection for Multi-label Learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320319302341) has been accepted to *Pattern Recognition*.

    * May 2019, I have moved to [CityU](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) for research study.

* #### Research Interests

    * Classification: multi-label learning, weakly supervised learning, class-imbalance learning

    * Feature selection and sparse representation

    * Deep learning: multi-label classification, deep learning on graphs 
    
    * Computational methods for optimization
    
    * Data mining applications in medicine: TCM health management, drug repositioning, hospital readmission, ASD prediction

    * Others: information fusion, recommendation systems

* #### Publications: at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=yBaTk-gAAAAJ&hl=en) (2016 - date)
