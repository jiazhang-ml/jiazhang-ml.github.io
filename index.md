#### What's Happening

* Jun. 2019, our paper on [Manifold Regularized Discriminative Feature Selection for Multi-label Learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320319302341) has been accepted to Pattern Recognition.
* May 2019, I have moved to [CityU](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) for research study.
